# PR
Pull requests let you tell others about changes you've pushed to a GitHub repository. Once a pull request is sent, interested parties can review the set of changes, discuss potential modifications, and even push follow-up commits if necessary/required

A fork is a copy of a repository. Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project. Most commonly, forks are used to either propose changes to someone else's project or to use someone else's project as a starting point for your own idea.

What does merge pull request do?

Merge a pull request into the upstream branch when work is completed. Anyone with push access to the repository can complete the merge. ... If you decide you don't want the changes in a topic branch to be merged to the upstream branch, you can close the pull request without merging.

Please don't commit directly to the master branch
Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request
